# story-wiki (work in progress)

<h2> Idea </h2>
This is a small system to organize your characters and other story elements in your worldbuilding in a wiki like fashion. You create articles for each element, order them by categories and search for an element in all your existing articles.

<h2> TODO </h2>
 - Everything that makes it look pretty, aka css and other snacks 
 - Tag system, to tag articles  
 - Search by category  
 - Search by tag 
 - A proper page to create projects and choose which project to work on 
 - Genral code cleanup and deleting of dead and unused code 
 - Proper comments and perhaps some javadoc 
 - Perhaps linking images articles
